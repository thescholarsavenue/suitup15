							<span style="font-size:50px;line-height: 1;">I</span>n the wee hours of a cold winter morning, while people are still tucked in tight under three warm blankets, an odd KGPian trudges towards Vikramshila. Clad in a crisp suit, her formal air is abruptly broken by her rickety bicycle. She reaches Nalanda complex, fragrant tensed faces all around; some greet her with worried smiles and quickly dive back into memorizing what their CVs speak about them. It is December 1st 2015, the first day of the on-campus placement process at IIT Kharagpur. Though hiring begins in december, the actual process usually starts by early September when companies fly down to KGP to give presentations in an effort to woo prospective employees. This is followed by CV submissions and written/online tests leading up to interviews in december. For some students the process starts as early as the summer of their third year, when they receive PPOs (Pre-Placement Offers). Despite the prospect of a fancy job title and a fat pay cheque, it can be a harrowing time for most final year students on campus. Here is an in-depth analysis of 2015's placement numbers, results of the survey CDC conducted among students who secured job offers, followed by all the recent developments in the CDC that promise a much smoother process for future batches.</p>

								<p>The December placement season lasted for 18 days from December 1st to 18th. In this span of time, 1036 job offers were made to 981 students, across 28 departmental streams. 130 students had already accepted pre-placement offers after their third year internships. Out of 1895 registered students, 51.76 % were hired. The placement percentage of 5 year undergraduate students (Dual degree/M.Sc./B.Arch) was the highest at 60.7%, followed by 4 year undergraduate students at 56.5% and postgraduate students at 36.2%. Day 1, as the hype has it, saw 144 students obtain job offers, highest among all days. UG 5th year students out-performed their fellow 4th year students on day one and two and performed almost as good as them later on. PG students spiked on day 3 with 40 job offers, but lost steam in the following days.</p>
								<p>
								The cumulative placement curves are fairly smooth, but for two inflection points due to placements on day 10 and day 16. This can be attributed to core companies hiring late in the placement season. Also, over 50% of the total people placed, were placed before day 5, which also means that 450 job offers were made after day 5, and that there is little reason to worry for people who don't make it in the first week.</p>

									The above visualization represents department-wise placements on each day, and number of people placed is proportional to the radius of the bubble. From first glance, departments can be categorized into various divisions - top heavy, spread out, sparse placements, etc. CS and EC clearly dominate for the first few days, whereas departments such as ME, CH, EE had consistent placements throughout the season. AE and IM had sparse, but consistent placements throughout. MI and CE had a significant boost on day 16. This qualitative behavior offers a partial picture and can be better understood by looking at how many people remained unplaced in each department (or placement percentage per department), since the number of those registered varies from 4 in QE to 203 in EC. 
								</p>
								<p>
									If we compare how various departments fared, CS topped the total percentage charts (86.2%) among engineering streams with over 20 students. And second in line was IM at 82%. The bottom-most department was AG, by a fairly wide margin. IM, CS, EC, CH, IE and ME had over 70% of their UG 4year students placed, while AE stood the lowest with 31.8%. But interestingly, AE UG 5year students performs considerably better than the B.Techs with 72.4% of them placed. The dual degree students generally outperform their B.Tech counterparts with EE, CS and IM securing over 80% placements. This establishes that Dual degree students have a slight advantage owing to the extra year, which means a possible extra internship and general experience. AR received little love from companies as it stood at 34.37%
								</p>

								<p>
								Among the sciences, HS 5 year course ruled the roost with 92.59% followed by MA at 75%. All 5 year science streams had over 50% placements, this season.

							</div>
							<div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3" style="text-align: left;">
								<p>
									UG 4 year students secured the highest number of PPOs (70) followed by UG 5 year students (57) and PG (3), which could be due to reluctance on the companies' part to award a PPO to a student who still has 2 more years left to study. It remains to be seen if the new rule that requires UG 5 year students to do their compulsory internship after their 4th year helps them is registering more PPOs. CS had the highest number of accepted PPOs (37), followed  by EC(18), and together they made up 42.3% of all PPOs accepted. Among the sciences, MA was on top, with 15 PPOs. Software development was clearly the most popular profile among accepted PPOs.

							</div>
							<div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3" style="text-align: left;">
								<p>
									The overall placement percentage of Female:Male students was at 48:52.02. Though this seems like both genders did equally well, a closer look reveals a grave disparity. The UG  women performed much better than their PG counterparts. 77.1% of registered UG 4 year female students and 83.8% of registered UG 5 year female students received job offers, whereas only 28.8% PG female students got placed. Among male students however, 67.9% UG 4 year students, 70.5% UG 5 year students and 36.3%. So, on an average, UG women had a 10% higher chance of getting placed than UG men, but PG women had around 8% less probability than PG men.

								<p>There were companies from six broad sectors and their breakup was as follows - Consulting-18, Core Engineering-86, Data Analytics-29,  Finance-14, Software Development-72, and 31 other Non-Core Profiles. A total of 250 company profiles hired from KGP this year. Out of these profiles, 214 did not have any CGPA cut-off, and an additional 26 had a cutoff less than or equal to 7. The logisics team of the CDC reports that a total of 237 hours of tests were conducted during December.

								<p>CGPA of undergraduate students who got placed <span class="redletter">averaged at 7.83 (median)</span>, while those of the unplaced students had a median of 7.43. But upon further inspection, we see another interesing trend. The registered CGPAs of both UGs and PGs is a near normal curve. But the unplaced histogram for UG students forms a skewed curve peaking between 6 and 6.5, whereas the unplaced histogram for PG students remains near normal. This could possibly mean that the CGPA is a bottleneck for UG students to get placed, whereas the bottleneck lies somewhere else, for PG students. This claim is further corroborated in further sections of this article, when graduating students were asked about what hurdles they faced in December, via a survey.
